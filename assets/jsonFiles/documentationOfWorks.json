The original concept I had for this was to be a first-person metroidvania centered around the use of a bow for both combat and puzzle solving.<br><br>There was a lot of other mechanics I had thought of, but didn't have the time to implement, and the majority of my time and effort was spent on programming, which unfortunately led to insufficient time to work on the level design. However, regardless of the rough state it may currently be in, this project was the first more complex 3D game project I developed with Unity (and in general), and I learned a lot from working on it.<h2>Original Design Document Excerpt</h2><h3 class='noBr'>Overview</h3><ul><li>A 3D first-person Metroidvania with Combat, but a primary focus on puzzles.</li><li>The game will focus around the use of a bow and arrow(s) for both combat and puzzle solving.</li><li>The arrows shot by the bow will embed themselves into the environment and may provide various effects, however, there is a limit on how many of these arrows may exist at once.</li><li>Shooting an arrow when at max arrow count will despawn the oldest arrow, or the player may manually despawn arrows.</li><li>Hitting an enemy will not count towards the arrow limit.</li><li>The max arrow limit will be raised throughout the game.</li><li>New arrow types will be introduced throughout the game.</li></ul><h3>Core Mechanics</h3><ul><li>Jumping / Platforming</li><li>Shooting Bow and Arrows</li><li>Picking Up And Dropping Objects</li></ul><h3>Player Actions</h3><ul><li>Walk / Run</li><li>Jump / Double Jump</li><li>Shoot Bow and Arrow</li><li>Change Arrow Type</li><li>Activate Buttons and Levers</li><li>Pick Up, Drop, and Throw Objects</li></ul><h3>Arrow Type Examples</h3><ul><li>Basic Arrow:<ul><li>Sticks into objects & can activate buttons / plates.</li><li>Deals damage to enemies.

This game started as a final project for my <em>Creative Coding 2</em> class, but I continued working on it for a few months afterwards.<br>This was by far the most complex project I had developed at the time, it was something I really enjoyed working on, and I learned a lot about game development and programming from making it.<h3>2.5D Raycasting Engine</h3>In case you're not aware, a 2.5D raycasting engine is a game engine that technically operates in 2D space, but is rendered to appear 3D. This is done by casting 'rays' from the player's position in a cone, and detecting at what distance it hits a wall, which determines the height that portion of the wall is rendered at. This type of rendering was common in the early days of \"3D\" P.C. video games, with some notable examples being <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, <em>Doom</em>, and <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>.

            "desc_detailed":    "<h2 class='noBr'>Overview</h2>A simple rogue-like with turn-based grid combat developed with Unity. Originally made as a semester long project for my <em>Game Engines</em> class. This project is fairly bare-bones, and I wasn't able to get nearly as much done as I had originally hoped, as I simply ran out of time. Because this was the first bigger project I developed in Unity, I had to do a lot of learning as I went, and ended up needing to rework large portions of it, so while it's not my best work, I'm still proud of all the work I put into it and how much I learned from making it.<h2>Original Design Document Excerpt</h2><h3 class='noBr'>A Brief Description</h3>Rogue-like with turn-based strategy grid combat similar to <em>Advance Wars</em>. Features a leveling system, equipment system, and uses a map system similar to <em>Slay the Spire</em>. The player plays the role of a necromancer who can summon undead units to fight their enemies.<h3>Combat</h3>Combat is turn-based and takes place upon a square grid. The player and A.I. will take turns where they may command every unit they have.<h4>Commander Unit</h4>The commander unit is a necromancer which represents the player tends to be much stronger than other units and as effective against all unit types. However, the commander is the only unit whose health doesn’t reset after battle, and the commander’s death results in a game over.<h4>Minion Units</h4>Other than the commander there are three other unit types: melee, ranged, and aerial. The unit types mostly act as a simple rock, paper, scissors dynamic within the prototype, but would ideally be expanded upon with greater complexity through additional types and differing levels of effectiveness against each other.<h4>Unit Stats</h4><ul><li>Movement Speed: Determines how far the unit may travel within a single turn.</li><li>Attack Range: Determines how close/far a target must be for the unit to attack it.</li><li>Accuracy: Determines chance to hit. (Most units have 100% accuracy, but this may be altered by effects or something.)</li><li>Health: Decreases when attacked, the unit will die if it reaches zero, and modifies how much damage the unit deals.</li><li>Attack: Determines how much base damage is dealt when the unit attacks. (Actual damage is affected by things like type effectiveness.)</li></ul><h4>Unit Types</h4><ul><li>Melee: Effective against range, but cannot hit aerial units (subject to change?).</li><li>Ranged: Effective against aerial units, but they’re slower and cannot attack units within 1 (2?) cell away from them.</li><li>Aerial: Effective against melee and they’re faster, but {more expensive? rarer? low accuracy?}.</li></ul><h4>Terrain</h4><ul><li>Various terrain types will have different defense values which decrease how much damage units on them will take from attacks.</li><li>Some terrain will decrease how far a unit may travel within one turn. Though some units (such as aerial) may not be affected by some of these speed penalties.</li></ul><h4>Unit Limitations</h4><ul><li>The commander unit is a necromancer, and as such can revive and heal/repair their units after every battle. And while the player isn’t limited by the number of units they may add to their army, they are limited to how many can be used within battle. This is because summoning a unit requires a specific amount of a limited resource (which is fully recovered after every battle).</li><li>All units have a rarity tier which may be used to determine if certain perks / equipment affect them. (ex: All basic minions have +4 health.)</li></ul><h3>Map System</h3><h4 class='noBr'>Map Layout</h4><ul><li>A map will consist of a series of connected dots where the player may travel from one dot to another. [FTL: Faster Than Light, Slay the Spire]</li><li>Each dot on the map will contain either a combat encounter, an event, or a rest point (& possibly a shop if I get that far).</li><li>Rest points (safe zone? campsite?) are where the player may replenish their commander’s health.</li></ul><h4>Map Events</h4><ul><li>Most map events that aren’t combat will be presented in the form of a short explanation presented alongside an image, with one or more possible outcomes to choose from.</li><li>The player may be given the opportunity to combine two or more of their units to create a single stronger unit.</li></ul>",
